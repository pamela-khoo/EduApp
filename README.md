# Education App - Kidooze

## üå± Introduction
<p align="justify">
<i>Kidooze</i> is an educational app for young children to teach them computational thinking and concept like pattern recognition, decomposition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking. 

This project was developed following scope from the ACM 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. The theme of CHI 2018 was ‚ÄòENGAGE‚Äô, and we were asked to contribute to this theme by 'Engaging Communities': use human-centred design approaches to develop a new way to support, empower, or change the behaviour of a group around a shared area of interest. To do so, our team chose to tackle the challenge of promoting lifelong learning with the following objectives:

- To promote life-long learning.
- To provide a user-friendly platform for children to cultivate and improve their computational thinking skills.
- To encourage and motivate children from a young age to enjoy learning.

## üç≠ Design Process
To ensure the app was suitable and engaging for young children, our team conducted UX research and came up with design solutions by:
- Sketching the draft design of key user interfaces based on the proposed functional requirements;
- Developing a skeleton system and low-fidelity wireframe;
- Pilot user testing based on relevant standard evaluation metric with a focus group;
- And finally developing the high-fidelity prototype:

## üìå Features
The final software application developed based on the UI/UX design includes the following functions:
